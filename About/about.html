    <h1 class="head">Hi Everyone.....</h1>
    <div class="para">
    <p class="para1">Hello! My name is Anu, and I hail from the vibrant city of Thrissur. I am proud to have recently graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Applications (BCA) from Calicut University. As a member of a loving middle-class family of four, I have always been surrounded by support and encouragement, which has played a pivotal role in shaping who I am today.</p>

        <h5>Personal Attributes</h5>
        
        <p>consider myself to be ambitious and driven. I thrive on challenges and continuously set new goals for myself. This relentless drive stems from my desire to excel and achieve greatness in everything I undertake. I firmly believe that there is always room for improvement and that with determination and hard work, one can overcome any obstacle.</p>
        
       <h5>Passions and Interests</h5>
        
        <p>In addition to my professional aspirations, I am deeply passionate about art. During my free time, I indulge in creating random artworks. Art, for me, is a powerful medium of expression. It allows me to convey emotions and ideas that are often beyond the realm of words. The interplay of colors and shapes in my artwork serves as a reflection of my inner thoughts and feelings, providing a sense of fulfillment and tranquility.</p>
        
        <h5>Career Aspirations</h5>
        
        <p>My ultimate goal is to secure a well-maintained job in a reputable company where I can apply my skills and knowledge while also contributing to the organization’s growth. I am eager to embrace opportunities that challenge me and allow me to grow both personally and professionally. I am particularly interested in roles that not only leverage my technical background but also provide avenues for innovation and creativity.</p><br>
        
        <p>In summary, I am an ambitious and driven individual with a strong passion for art and a steadfast commitment to achieving my career goals. I am excited about the future and the opportunities that lie ahead, and I am confident that with my determination and hard work, I will be able to make a meaningful impact in my chosen field.<br>
        
        Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I look forward to connecting with like-minded professionals and exploring opportunities that align with my aspirations.</p>
